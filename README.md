# CSCI-258-ch9-11-Tutoring-App
This repo is for the a class Django Project for Web App Development called Tutoring App

#TODOS (Requirements from Canvas):
1. Treat this assignment as a consulting job.  I have asked you to create a tutoring app that displays tutoring hours in the CS fishbowl.  Below are a few specifics.  You need to ask me questions in class about what I want in this app.  Don't assume anything.  You do not want to create an app for me that doesn't do what I wanted.  

2. The home page of the app should display all tutoring hours by all TAs.   Format as you wish. 

3. TA's will "Sign Up" on your app.  You will need to collect information such as - what class they would be a good tutor for.  Example:  CSCI 150, CSCI 151.  

4. You will have a database of hour, day, TA.  TA's will add hours they are available.  You should only see the link to add hours, if you are signed in as a TA.  

5. TA's should be clickable on the homepage - when clicked - should direct you to a TA detail page listing information about the TA including classes they would be a good tutor for.
